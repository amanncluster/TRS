**For backend structure:

1.Go to official website of visual studio code and setup will be downloaded.
2.Go to the node.js website , also download long term service(LTS)_,simple install node.js.then go command prompt write [node -v](we see the version)
also here we see package manager also downloaded...so here we write[npm -v](we see the package manager version)..
3.For react app install we take help from package write command prompt[ npm install create-react-app--global]
{for here writing global we can created react app anywhere in my system}..
4.Then i go to desktop ..create a folder MERN..then i go to mern folder and create a folder name test,inside this we create another folder name backend
also created another folder frontend...
5.Now open our backend folder with any code editor(like visual  studio)..
6.Then in vs code we create new file index.js...
7.Then we go new terminal  and write here [npm init -y]{for this code convert this folder or package in node js package.}
8.Then again we go new terminal and write here [npm i express]{after express install we can see a node modules create in folder automatically,also
created package lock json file,we see here list dependency of dependency}
9.Then in the index.js file we will write 'const express = require("express");{we want to express from express package.we write code in this way in this file.}
10.Then we create database.js file for database configuration..
11.We make folders for controllers,then routes,then models and then create library folder and then create a file inside it helper.js.....this is our backend 
project consisting of express and node...
12.To connect MongoDB or perform the operation of MongoDB,we use Mongoose package...for this we write in terminal[ npm i mongoose]{this code help us connectivity 
with MongoDB and helps in creating schema.

**For frontend structure:

13.Again we open fronted folder with visual studio code then we go to new terminal create-react-app .{then here we see many folders in installed automatically}
14.We go to index.html and write in terminal [npm start] {Then our frontend project will start running on localhost:3000}
In this way we setup our fornted and backent setup..

**For Reactjs and Nodejs in one terminal(concurrently):

1.For this at first go to new terminal write[npm init -y]{we see automatically created a packet.json file}
2.we need concurrent package for this at first we go browser and type [concurrently npm] and we find this package and copy a command[npm i concurrently] 
then go new terminal and paste there that command.{then automatically downloaded concurrently package}
3.Then in package.json we have to make 2 scripts 1 script name will be "frontend" : "cd frontend && npm start" and other script name will be "backend" : ""cd backend && npm start",
then we create another script "start": "concurrently \"npm run frontend\" \"npm run backend\""
we go backend folder and in package.json we create a script "start":  "nodemon index"{nodemon is a package at 1st we need to install it globally where from file server always restart.
4.then we go to backend folder in index.js file we write simple code 
app.listen(
    5000,
    () => console.log("backend is running")
)
5.Then we go to terminal  and simply write[npm run start]{then we see backend is running and fronted also runnning}

**For database connection with mongodb:

1.Go browser and type mongodb.com and create a acccount follow step by step.change ip address 0.0.0.0

user name:amanncluster              
password:s0maliha                                                                                                                                
connection string:mongodb+srv://amanncluster:<password>@amann.pqpstfv.mongodb.net/?retryWrites=true&w=majority&appName=Amann

2.Create a folder  first and open with visual stuio and open new terminal write [npm init -y] in terminal also write [npm i mongoose]
then go to browser and write mongoose npm package
